<header><h1>The time I Happened Into Minneapolis</h1></header>
<p>Ok so i host trivia, and my quizzers (what i call the people that play) become my actual friends. There was a group of quizzer dudes that routinely hung out with me after the game, and would invite me to dinners and stuff outside of the games. I'm terrible with asking to hang out with people but I'll go almost anywhere if asked in the name of adventure. They knew this and invited me to their yearly company retreat, which happened to be in Minneapolis.</p>    
<p>So i call into work so i could have the weekend off. There was a bus scheduled to take us away early that friday morning, and i spent the ride sleeping honestly. We talked some but i was mostly exhausted</p>
<p>idunno it was fun, i'm tired of writing things the end.</p>
